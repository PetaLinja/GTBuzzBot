# GTBuzzBot

Project starts in index.html and utilizes multiple CDN links for Bootstrap and jquery. 
Our project aims to provide students and faculty, a user friendly chat assistant focused on modern design and aesthetics. GTBuzzBot incorporates Microsoft Azure's QnA API, which we used to train and publish a chat bot that will answer general Georgia Tech related questions.
